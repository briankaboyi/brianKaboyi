### 🚀 About Me

Hi! I’m Brian — a mobile developer passionate about building **delightful, high-performance mobile apps**. I specialize in **Flutter**, and lately I’ve been diving deeper into **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** to expand my Android expertise.

I'm self-taught, fueled by curiosity, and committed to writing clean, scalable code that solves real problems.
